# liri-node-app

1. This app attemps to solve many problems. The first is that it allows people to find out where any music artist is playing a concert at a specific location in the country. The second is that it pulls information for any movie on the OMDB database. The third is that it can provide a link to any song on spotify and display information of that artist.

2. This app is organized into certain components. The first is the declaration of all my variables that consist of axios, spotify, dotenv, moment.js, and filesystem. Second, I declare my spotify keys for the app to use along with the moment.js command. Then I performed the npm installs and initialized the JSON packages into the correct directory on my computer. Following this, I declared the command and input methods with the corresponding process.argv statements. Lastly, I made four switch commands with each required component consisting of the four cases. These are spotify-this-song, concert-this, movie-this, and do-what-it-says. All of these switch commands contains code that allows the app to function correctly. Additionally, there is a default console.log command incase the user inputs an invalid input for any of the command when running the app.

3. To run the app, open the terminal while in the liri.js window of VS code. Then you cd into the correct file directory of the computer, which is called liri-node-app on my computer. After installing all the required packages and creating a JSON package file with the command 'npm init -y' in the terminal, perform the commands to display the  information that the app is intended to display.

6.  The technologies used in this app are node, the spotify api, axios (while pulling from te OMDB api), moment.js, and DotEnv. 

7. My role in this apps development is being the sole creator of this app because I wrote the code from scratch. After doing so, the app is able to pull data from multiple apis and give back information that is 100% accurate.
